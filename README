youtube-dl-playlist is a Node.js program that uses youtube-dl to download an entire playlist loaded in from a JSON file.
The program automatically will download all tracks with the best audio available, then convert them into mp3 files and
add ID3v2 frames to the file.

The JSON file must be an array where each item must match the following schema:
{
	"title": string,
	"artist": string,
	"album"?: string,
	"nr"?: number,
	"year"?: number,
	"url": string,
	"fallback_urls"?: string[]
}
